# Tasks

- [x] Proper comparison of VCards
  - I push VCard 4 but get back VCard 3
- [ ] Make `uid` optional (fall back on `id`)
- [ ] More output by default
  - List any records with a change
  - Maybe add a `--quiet` flag to skip all output except errors
- [ ] Log commit hash at last push
  - This should add support for seeing what has changed
